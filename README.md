## Welcome to my website ðŸ˜„

This website serves as my portfolio. It was created for my Front End Web Development class at Portland State University.
**PLEASE NOTE***: the link to visit Frupal under "Projects" will appear broken, but it is the right link. It appears broken because the repo is set to private (due to the project being a group project with 4 others). I am checking with my old groupmates to see if I could make the repo public or else just fork it into my own repo.

### Stack used

I used HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript.

### Design

I was inspired by Rachel Andrew's [website](https://rachelandrew.co.uk/). I wanted something bold as well, so I went with a bright, modern theme that is still easy to read. Somewhere along the way I found a tiled background image of bananas with a cheerful shade of yellow, so I incorporated that in as well.

### Running the code

Clone the repository, then run it using Live Server or open it up in your browser.
Currently, the form submission is not working but it will be implemented in the future.

### Where the site is deployed
