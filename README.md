## Welcome to my website ðŸ˜„

This website serves as my portfolio. It was created for my Front End Web Development class at Portland State University.

### Stack used

I used HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript.

### Design

I was inspired by Rachel Andrew's [website](https://rachelandrew.co.uk/). I wanted something bold as well, so I went with a bright, modern theme that is still easy to read. Somewhere along the way I found a tiled background image of bananas with a cheerful shade of yellow, so I incorporated that in as well.

### Running the code

Clone the repository, then run it using Live Server or open it up in your browser.
Currently, the form submission is not working but it will be implemented in the future.
